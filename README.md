Project 2: Typography by Joshua Thatcher

# project overview
This website is a visually typographic portrayal of what the word community means to me personally. For the purpose of this project, I chose the song "I'll Be There for You" by the Rembrandts. This song was created as the theme song for the hit TV show, "Friends", and holds special meaning to me. 

Community to me means a group of people who come together to support each other in a common goal. Sometimes that common goal could be something like a sport, hobby, academic focus, or anything really. Sometimes a community is just formed from a group of people who simply choose to spend their time together. Whatever the reason, communities are always built on a system of support and encouragement, which is one reason I found the lyrics of this song to be very fitting.

Communities to me also embrace each other and support each other particularly when things get tough in times of need when people need the most help. Because of this, I chose to use lyrics that emphasize the role of community during hard times, such as "When the rain starts to fall" and "Someone to face the day with", as well as "Even at my worst I'm best with you".

The lyrics that I chose to use from the song includes phrases like "I'll be there for you, Cause you're there for me too", which really hammers home the supportive nature of communities for me. It doesn't matter the circumstances, communities are all about supporting each other through thick and thin.

# technical overview
For this project I was restricted to only using typography and color in combination with animation to design the website. I began by choosing the song I would be working with, and then narrowing down the specific lyrics that I would be using after that. At this point I hand-sketched some ideas on paper, and from here I set off inserting all of the lyrics into my html and then started organizing each phrase into it's own separate scrollable window. For the entirety of this website, I used Visual Studio Code as my editor, with the addition of GitHub to host my repository and publish the website.

I created various combinations of animations using keystrokes, ranging from simple translations, to rotations, color shifting, opacity changes, and more. I also used some more intricate animation functions such as box-shadow, filter: blur, and more. Both of these animations were used to create the first window of the word "Day" lighting up into a Sun before blurring away into Moonlight.

# acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function for their assistance in helping to understand how to better use filter css functions in my animations. I also received helpful feedback and assistance with coding from my peers and instructor, Joshua Oakley.
